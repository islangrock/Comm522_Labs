Fighting for the people meant fighting on behalf of survivors of sexual assault‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa fight not just against predators but a fight against silence and stigma.‚Å£

‚Å£
For the people meant fighting for middle-class families who had been defrauded by banks and were losing their homes by the millions in the Great Recession. We went after the five biggest banks in the United States and won $20 billion for California homeowners and together we passed the strongest anti-foreclosure law in the United States of America.

Fifteen years later, Howard made history when she became the first woman promoted to the rank of a four-star admiral. #BlackHistoryMonth","2018","2","1","https://www.instagram.com/p/BeqUs63FveC/"

Board of Education decision that banned segregation. On their first day of school, the Little Rock Nine were escorted past an angry mob by federal troops to start their first day at Little Rock Central High. As the school year went on, they would endure violent threats, harassment, and even have acid thrown on them. The courage and bravery they embodied would pave the way for desegregation at schools, but the struggle they endured still persists today.

"kamalaharris","21","3723","Photo","‚ÄúFive years ago, I was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma, a week after turning 39. I had five tumors ‚Äî one in my leg, two in my intestine, one in my lung, and one in my brain. I had multiple surgeries, radiation on my brain, and was treated with infusions of immunotherapy. I had excellent doctors because California has excellent doctors. Thank God, at that time, I was lucky. I had just signed up for the Affordable Care Act insurance, and I started a job three weeks before my first hospitalization. So I was covered. But what worries me is the future.

I currently see my oncologist every three months, alternating scans of my body and brain for any sign that my melanoma ‚Äî a notoriously tricky, resilient, and deadly cancer when caught at stage 4 ‚Äî has come back. If I face lifetime limits on my insurance, if I have to pay out of a health care savings account, if I'm put in an expensive high-risk pool or am placed on cut-rate insurance because I have a pre-existing condition, I'm done for. I cannot pay for it. My family cannot (even with insurance, sophisticated surgeries are expensive!).

My freshman year in college at UC Santa Cruz, I was losing weight for no reason, and was thirsty and tired all the time. By the time I got to the hospital my blood sugar numbers were over 1000. I was very close to coma stage. 
As soon as I came off my mother's insurance at 24, the battle for my life began. I would get all the way to the end of insurance applications and as soon as I would get to the pre-existing condition category, I would be denied. Because of the years of back and forth I have developed two complications from diabetes: neuropathy (nerve damage in my legs and feet) and gastroparesis (nerve damage in my stomach causing ultra slow digestion). It was not until Obama was in office that the pre-existing discrimination wore off a bit. Even now with the Affordable Care Act, I still have to fight for necessity medicine and management tools that I need to stay alive so I cannot imagine anything that is going backward.

Jim and John wanted to become legally married but since same-sex marriage wasn‚Äôt legal in Ohio, they traveled to Maryland, where same-sex marriage was legal. 
Three months after their wedding, John passed away. Before his death, the couple filed a lawsuit to force Ohio to recognize Jim as the surviving spouse on John‚Äôs death certificate. Though a federal judge ruled in favor of Jim, the state of Ohio challenged this ruling and won. So Jim took his case to the Supreme Court. In 2015, thanks to Jim‚Äôs courageous fight, the Supreme Court ruled in Jim‚Äôs favor and stated that the Constitution does indeed protect the right to same-sex marriage. #PrideMonth","2017","6","16","https://www.instagram.com/p/BVaNCUpFLg9/"

In 2017, that promise still is unfulfilled. That is why I'm marching. I am marching for women of color who are marginalized across the country, especially at the ballot box. I am marching for the women who aren't paid the same as men. I am marching for the women who are under attack by politicians trying to eliminate their right to choose and limit their access to comprehensive reproductive health care. I am marching for women who can‚Äôt speak up when they‚Äôre sexually assaulted. I am marching for our immigrant and LGBTQ communities, who are still not treated equally under the law. I am marching for the women that came before us and the women that follow in our footsteps. We must come together and show the new administration that we will not be silent ‚Äî and we will not be silenced. The Republicans may have taken an election, but they did not take our power.

We cannot throw up our hands at a time that requires all of us to roll up our sleeves. This is why we must come together right now ‚Äî not despair ‚Äî and fight for who we are and the country we want to be. 
Here‚Äôs what I envision for our future: I dream of a world where we don‚Äôt play politics with public health policy. One day, we will become a country where women have access to health care and reproductive rights. I imagine a nation where 12 million hard-working immigrants are finally able to come out of the shadows and fully participate in the full light of the American economy. To those naysayers who suggest there is no such thing as climate change, I say we can become a nation that works to save our planet from climate change and puts an end to oil companies manipulating our laws. I believe in a more perfect union without the mass incarceration of African-American men. I hope for a world where we don‚Äôt sink our college students with a lifetime of debt just so big banks and for-profit colleges can bathe in the riches. 
Our ideals are at stake right now and we will have to fight for who we are. This is a pivotal moment in the history of America. Our work is just beginning.","2017","1","20","https://www.instagram.com/p/BPfr0GGgd9l/"
"kamalaharris","83","5874","Photo","On President Barack Obama‚Äôs last full day in office, I wanted to thank him for everything that he‚Äôs done for our country. Eight years ago, we were a nation facing the worst economic crisis in a generation. We were losing thousands of jobs each month and the auto industry was on the verge of collapse. But President Obama turned that around and rebuilt our economy, adding 15.8 million private-sector jobs since February 2010. During his time as president, he was committed to protecting the environment and reversing climate change. His global efforts resulted in the historic Paris Climate Agreement and he protected more than 550 million acres of America‚Äôs public lands and waters. Since he entered office eight years ago, 20 million more adults have health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act. We can‚Äôt leave these people, some who have health insurance for the first time in years, behind in the dust. And finally, but not lastly, President Obama led the fight to protect everyone ‚Äî no matter their sex, race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, class, age, or ability. This list just scratches the surface of everything he‚Äôs done for our nation. We must continue his fight and ensure that the progress we made under his leadership isn‚Äôt lost.","2017","1","19","https://www.instagram.com/p/BPdI8JjA0r6/"

"kamalaharris","25","1030","Photo","Team, today we received the endorsement of President @barackobama. I am so grateful for his support, and humbled by his words: ‚ÄúI am proud to endorse Kamala Harris for United States Senate because I've seen her work.

Kamala is a lifelong courtroom prosecutor with only one client: the people of the State of California.

That's the approach she'll take to the United States Senate.

Kamala's experience has taught her that if you're going to give everybody a fair shot, you've got to take on the special interests that too often stand in the way of progress.

As Attorney General, she fought the big banks that took advantage of homeowners across the country - and she won.

She cracked down on transnational gangs exploiting women and children - and she won.

She took on big for-profit colleges that were swindling students and leaving them with a lifetime of debt and a worthless degree - and she won.

She took on big oil companies to defend California's beautiful coast and its landmark law to fight climate change - and she won.

Her leadership helped ensure the right of all Americans to marry the person they love.

And throughout her lifetime as a prosecutor, Kamala Harris has been a leading voice for criminal justice reform, challenging old dogma and insisting we be 'smart on crime' by ending mass incarceration.

Kamala Harris fights for us.  That's why I'm so proud to endorse her for United States Senator.  And if you send her to the Senate, she'll be a fearless fighter for the people of California - all the people of California - every single day.‚Äù","2016","7","19","https://www.instagram.com/p/BIC4DB_jR1E/"

A two for one Senatorial Selfie: Here I am pictured with Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts, my current colleague, and Kamala Harris now running for Senate in California who I hope will be my colleague in January. Senator Warren is a powerful force in the Senate and one of our nation's most significant advocates and activists for economic justice. Senator Warren and I have partnered on many issues and measures from efforts to improve public education, to working to bring diversify to public pension management. Most recently we partnered on retirement security making sure that financial planners, advisors and their firms must act in the best interests of their clients (The Fiduciary Rule). I am proud to be partnering with Senator Warren now in our support and endorsement of Kamala Harris in her senate race. Kamala and I have been friends for years. She is an extraordinary person and leader. Even before she decided to run for the Senate, I was encouraging her to run because I knew she would difference for California and our nation. She is definitely a rising political star and will be a great US Senator. I am proud of her and inspired by her candidacy.","2016","6","18","https://www.instagram.com/p/BGzZPqvLvz_/"

"kamalaharris","7","382","Photo","Martin Luther King, Jr. Day is very personal for me. As we celebrate Dr. King and remember the history of struggle that came before us, I wanted to share a personal memory with you.

I took this photo the last time I was in DC. As I looked up at the stunning Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial, I could almost hear the chants that echoed across Berkeley when my parents took me to rallies.

As a child of the Civil Rights Movement, I often say that my sister and I grew up surrounded by adults who were always marching and shouting about this thing called ""justice.""

The cry for justice was never more powerful, more inspiring, or more urgent, than when it came from Dr. King. He taught us that it is our moral obligation to pursue justice, equality, and peace for all, no matter their race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or sexual orientation.

We are fortunate that there are so many who are working to carry his legacy forward. The activists who march in the street to protest injustices in their communities. The pastors who demand economic opportunity in long-suffering neighborhoods. The teachers who ensure that where a child is born doesn‚Äôt determine the quality of that child‚Äôs education or what they can achieve in the future. Our collective commitment to demanding a justice system where the color of one‚Äôs skin does not predetermine the measure of justice received.

To honor Dr. King, his vision, and the great promise of this country, we must re-commit ourselves to his dream every day. Let‚Äôs go forward fearlessly, tirelessly, and resolved to work together until the promise of justice is secured for our children and our children‚Äôs children. #MLKDay","2016","1","18","https://www.instagram.com/p/BAskzRQrv0X/"

"joebiden","3213","140880","Photo","Nine years ago today, the Affordable Care Act was passed into law. You may remember that I had a few words to share with President Obama about how important I thought this bill was... Almost a decade later I still feel just as strongly. Not only did we increase the number of Americans with health insurance by 20 million by the time we left office, but we expanded the rights of all Americans by banning insurers from denying coverage or increasing premiums due to pre-existing conditions, requiring insurers to cover recommended preventive services including certain cancer screenings, and eliminating annual lifetime caps on insurance coverage.

This law has made a difference in the lives of countless Americans who now have the peace of mind that health care offers. 
That is a BFD.","2019","3","23","https://www.instagram.com/p/BvXZf0PhTod/"
